## Web Memory Game
This is a web version of the classic memory game many people played as kids. The goal of the game is to match 8 pairs of cards in as few turns as possible.

### About
This is a project I did for the Udacity [Front End Web] (https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) developer nanodegree. The project uses jQuery for DOM manipulation and css animations  to flip the cards as well as javascript for the basic game logic. To play the game in any browser simply download the files and in the browser open `index.html`.

### Dependencies

The game is dependent on [jQuery] (https://jquery.com/) and a [google font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Coda) which it installs from a CDNs. Other than that all that's needed are the included files.
